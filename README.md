PasaPi Demo App
=====================

PasaPi (Friends in Newari Language) - Stay Informed about Friends
Simple Friends Info management application using IONIC Framework.


## Using this project

This is a simple app to implement CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality using IONIC Framework on the top of Phonegap/Cordova. This application is designed for Iphone, Android and Windows Phone but can also be deployed as Blackberry Application. I name it as PasaPi (Friends in newari Language) targeting management of Friend's Info. 
As, charts are the best way to share the information than words so, I have also added some extra perks like visualizing the Friends Data using Charts.js and Angular Charts. 

In this application I have implemented an additional functionality which is Directive. Directives are the part of AngularJS Framework which helps developer to extend the standard functionality. In this application, use of directive is applied to the "Add/Edit User Template" to focus the first Input Element in our View. You can have a look in the "/www/js/directives.js" and yes we have to add this directives.js file to our base html file that is "index.html" as well as to our Module as a Dependency in "app.js" file. 


This Project is started using ionic default starter

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```
